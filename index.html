      <h3>Why did we choose modelrockets?</h3>
      <p class="answer">We both were interested in rocket science and previusly built our own rockets. It was fascinating to us what we could achive with an arduino, some sensors and a rocket motor, so we decided to make a website about that topic.</p>

      <h3>How are we going to realize our Project?</h3>
      <p class="answer">We are going to create a simple website about modelrockets and how to make rocketfuel, where we describe the most important parts of a modelrocket. We will explain parts like the rocket motor, payload-section, boardcomputer and the parachute for example. As a webapp we want to create a simple UI where you can create your own rocket.</p>
